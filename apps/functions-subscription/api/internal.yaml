        This is an asynchronous operation. Along with trial creation, this also generates resources to manage events related to trial subscription.

        The following resources are generated:
          - A Service Bus Queue where all events for trial subscriptions are sent
          - A Service Bus Topic Subscription with a rule to forward topic messages to the appropriate queue
          - A User Assigned Identity for third-party access to Trial System published events on the queue
